<h1><i>My travel blog to COX'S BAZAR</i></h1>
<div>
    <p>The locals were friendly and welcoming, and I learned a lot about their way of life. I even got to try some fresh seafood, which was delicious. My visit to Cox's Bazar was an incredible experience. The natural beauty of the beach, the variety of activities, and the friendly locals all made for a memorable trip.<button><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%27s_Bazar">read more</a></button></p>
